====================
KNOWN BUGS IN PHPESP
====================

- If a question is required, it is possible to select an !other field,
  and not fill in the box.
  [ admin/include/lib/espresponse.inc:13:check_required() ]

- Data export files are dumped in /tmp and owned by the web server
  user.  A work around for this is to change the 'home' of a user in
  the authentication library in use.
  [ admin/include/lib/esppauth-default.inc:170 ]
  [ admin/include/lib/esppauth-ldap.inc:229 ]

- Cross analysis on '!other' options is a bit suspect.
