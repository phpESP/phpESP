PHPESP CREDITS
==============

This software was initially written for eGrad.com.  I would like to
thank everyone there and the company's commitment to open source
software.

Further development past version 1.0 has been a product of my "spare
time".  I would like to thank college for all the spare time and the
bandwidth. ;-)

Additional help in ideas, criticism, testing, and code from Romans
Jasins <roma at latnet.lv>.  Thanks Roma, especially for the Javascript
and HTML help. Get some sleep!

Authentication enhancements and CSV export additions were sponsored by
The University of Vermont <www.uvm.edu>.

The "Section Text" enhancements, survey themes, and cross analysis GUI
were provided by Kon Angelopoulos <angekgabiel at iprimus.com.au>.

Additional development by The ITLab <www.itlab.musc.edu>

The save and resume, navigation, and self sign-up enhancements were
